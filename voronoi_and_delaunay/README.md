>Left-Click to place points

>Right-Click to compute and draw the voronoi diagram and its dual Delaunay graph (drawn together can be toggled on/off)

>Press R to reset/clear canvas

>Press D to toggle display (on/off) of the Delaunay graph 

>Press V to toggle display (on/off) of the voronoi diagram

can take input points through stdin if want to see degenerate cases. For the input format look in testcase.txt, use it with
```
make exe
./exe _ < testcase.txt
```
apologies for this lazy command format.
